# News Categorizer with LSTM and Flask

## Introduction
This project implements a news categorizer using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Flask for the web interface, and the News API for fetching news articles. The goal is to categorize news articles into predefined categories using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Categorization of news articles into predefined categories.
- Utilizes LSTM networks for sequence processing and classification.
- Web interface for users to input news articles and get categorized results.
- Integration with the News API for fetching real-time news data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks
- Flask
- News API
